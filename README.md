# Dynamic-Programming

Several NP-weak problem solutions with dynamic-programming approach. All the algorithms are space complexity optimized and implemented in pure C language.

## Problems

* 0-1 Knapsack Problem
* Levenshtein Distance
* Longest Common Subsequence
* Longest Increasing Subsequence
* Rod Cutting Problem
* Shortest Common Supersequence
* Subset Sum Problem
* Word Break problem

## Benchmark Tests

### Execution Time Analysis (in milliseconds)

The algorithms are tested with AMD Ryzen 5 3500u. The columns are the input lengths.
